Description: Accesses high resolution raster maps using the OpenStreetMap
    protocol. Dozens of road, satellite, and topographic map servers are directly
    supported. Additionally raster maps
    may be constructed using custom tile servers.  Maps can be
    plotted using either base graphics, or ggplot2. This package is not affiliated
    with the OpenStreetMap.org mapping project.
